##  How to Solve Programming Problems:
- First is The **most** common mistake when someone try to solve a programming problem is they try to *start writing code as soon as possible*, they really want to make sure they take ***enough time*** to **understand** the problem completely *before* attempting to solve it. 
### simple steps to Solve Programming Problems:
1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.
## The 5 Whys:
- The 5 Whes simply is:  
    - when a problem occurs, you drill down to its root cause by asking "Why?" five times. Then, when a counter-measure becomes apparent, you follow it through to prevent the issue from recurring.
    
### How to Use the 5 Whys:
 1. Assemble a Team:
2. Define the Problem:
    -  observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on
3. Ask the First "Why?"
    - Asking your team *why* the problem is occurring.

4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times:
5. Know When to Stop:
    - when asking "why" produces no more useful responses,thats mean we reached the **root** cause of the problem.

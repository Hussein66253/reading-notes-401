- In this read  first I will provide answers to the following prompts:

## 1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development:
  1. Better program design and higher code quality.
  2. Detailed project documentation 
  3. TDD reduces the time required for project development
    
## 2. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
- we can figure out the case by reading the following:  
    - **beforeEach()** is run before each test in a describe.
    - **afterEach()**  is run after each test in a describe.
   
## 3. What is one downside of Test Driven Development?
 - It takes a lot of time and effort which creates a sense of **slow development**.
 - it's hard to test the interface because of continuous changes.

## 4. What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
 - The most important difference between class- and prototype-based inheritance is that a class defines a type which can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance.
## 5. Name use case for a static method?
 - The most common example of a static method is main()method.
## Documenting the following Vocabulary Terms:
***Term***      |      **Documenting** 
  -------------      |      -------------
  *Functional programming:*      |      Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions style. It is a declarative type of programming styler     
  *pure function*      |       is a function that has the following properties: Its return value is the same for the same arguments (no variation with local static variables, non-local variables, mutable reference arguments or input streams from I/O devices)
  *higher-order function*      |      A higher-order function is a function that can take another function as an argument, or that returns a 
  *Immutable state*      |      Immutable state is state that cannot be changed.
  *object*      |      An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value.
  *object-oriented programming* |  object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions
  *Classes*      |      Classes are a template for creating objects. 
  *prototype*      |     The prototype is an object that is associated with every functions and objects by default in JavaScript,  
  *super*      |      The super keyword refers to the parent class
  *Inheritance*      |      Inheritance is an important concept in object oriented programming. In the classical inheritance, methods from base class get copied into derived class. In JavaScript, inheritance is supported by using prototype object
 *constructor*      |      a constructor gets called when you declare an object using the new keyword. The purpose of a constructor is to create an object and set values if there are any object properties present
 *“instance”*      |      An “instance” means a reference to an “object” created by “new” or the equivalent
 *Context*      |    Context is related to objects. It refers to the object to which a function belongs.  
 *this*      |   this keyword, it refers to the object to which function belongs.   
 *TDD*      |      Test Driven Development (TDD) is a process for writing software that provably satisfies the software requirements. 
 *Jest*      |      Jest is an open JavaScript testing library . While Jest can be used to test any JavaScript library
 *(CI)*      |    Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project.   
 *unit test*      |      A unit test is a way of testing a unit - the smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated in a system

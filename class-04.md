## Why would a developer choose to make data models?
- A data model helps design the database at the conceptual, physical and logical levels.
 Data Model structure helps to define the relational tables, primary and foreign keys 
and stored procedures. It provides a clear picture of the base data and can be used by database developers to create a physical database.

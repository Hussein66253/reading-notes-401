# linked list
 ## What is the use of a linked list?
- Linked lists are linear data structures that hold data in individual objects called **nodes**. These nodes hold both the **data** and a **reference** to the next node in the list. Linked .
- **The first** and **last node** of a linked list usually are called the **head** and **tail** of the list, we can traverse the list *starting* at the ***head*** and *ending* at the **tail**. 
- The **tail node** is a special node, where the **next pointer** is always pointing or linking to a ***null*** reference, indicating **the end of the list**.
## Type of Linked List:
1. **Simple Linked List:** Item navigation is forward only.
2. **Doubly Linked List:** I tems can be navigated forward and backward.
3. **Circular Linked List:** Last item contains link of the first element as next and the first element has a link to the last element as previous.


## Advantages of linked list
1. Linked List is Dynamic data Structure .
2. Linked List can grow and shrink during run time.
3. Insertion and Deletion Operations are Easier.

## Which is better array or linked list?
- It follows that **linked lists** should be *used* for **large lists of data** where the **total number** of items in the list is **changing**. **Arrays**, on the other hand, are better suited to **small lists**, where the **maximum number** of items that could be on the list *is known*.
